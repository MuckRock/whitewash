I appeal.\r\n\r\nI have made FOIA requests to your agency in various capacities. Therefore, it seems prudent to determine the fee category on a case by case basis depending upon the specific request. Although I have made requests in the past as both a representative of the news media and as a personal \u201call other\u201d requester, I have never made any FOIA request as a commercial user. To be clear, I am not selling the information I receive nor has anyone paid me to obtain this information in this specific FOIA request or any that I have ever filed in the past. Additionally, I have no other commercial motives to make this request.\r\n\r\nI suggest the \u201call other\u201d fee category for this specific request because the primary purpose of this request is my own personal curiosity of a government function. I will be making the records public and they will be reviewed by other members of the news media. However, in this specific case, I am not yet certain if my personal interests will result in turning the information received into a unique work product and published in the news media. Since I am not yet certain if I will be creating a news media piece with this information, I will not venture to argue this should be billed in the news media fee category. I will however argue that billing in the commercial fee category is an untenable position that must be reversed as the result of this appeal, as there is no commercial interest behind this request.\r\n\r\nIn speaking with other DHS components recently, I understand that the DHS has circulated a memo requiring all requests coming from MuckRock users to be billed using the commercial fee category. The reason I was given over the telephone for this was that MuckRock is charging a fee to make FOIA requests on behalf of their users. First of all, charging a nominal fee for filing a request on another\u2019s behalf is not the same thing as selling the data received. Paying for MuckRock services is more akin to paying a secretary to lick and stamp an envelope. Of course you would not charge all users who use the services of a secretary commercial use fees. Further, for this specific request, I can assure you that I have not paid anyone to make this request on my behalf. Additionally, I believe that the decision to consider MuckRock a commercial user of FOIA comes from a misunderstanding of what MuckRock is. MuckRock is an investigative tools website which provides tools for filing FOIA requests. MuckRock does sell a subscription service to use these tools. However, the end user is directly communicating with the agency. In my case, I am personally writing my own FOIA requests and directly sending them to your agency. I am personally writing this appeal on my own and communicating with you directly. I am using MuckRock to do this for the sake of proper FOIA request tracking. The MuckRock system has created a special email account specific to this FOIA request, so we can communicate about this request and track that communication appropriately. The MuckRock system tracks the date the request was sent and alerts me if too much time passes without a response so I can follow up with you. These tools that MuckRock offers are quite similar to other FOIA users tracking their requests in an Excel spreadsheet; however, MuckRock is far more capable in many ways than Excel. The indiscriminate labeling of MuckRock users as commercial is no more appropriate than labeling all Microsoft Excel users as such.\r\n\r\nMy relationship with MuckRock is limited to (a) the use of their services to help with managing my FOIA requests and (b) the submission of an occasional freelance news piece to the MuckRock News service. MuckRock News is where MuckRock posts news media work primarily created with the editorial skills of journalists using records released under the freedom of information act as a source to create a unique work product ( See https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/ ). I have no commercial interest in their services. Any recommendation I have made is solely as a satisfied user, just as a person who finds Microsoft Office useful might recommend that product to others. I have no ownership interest in MuckRock. I have no financial interest whatsoever in anything MuckRock does.\r\n\r\nI trust that upon re-consideration, you will reverse the decision to bill me as a commercial user. However, if you deny this appeal, I see little choice left than to initiate a lawsuit to compel the appropriate fee category use.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your timely consideration of my appeal in every way possible. In any case, I will expect to receive your decision within 20 business days, as required by the statute.\r\n\r\nThank you for your assistance.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\nJason Smathers", "delivered": null, "status": null, "opened": false, "likely_foia": null}, {"files": [{"ffile": "https://muckrock.s3.amazonaws.com/foia_files/2014-HQAP-00040_Ack_Letter.pdf", "id": 16721, "title": "2014-HQAP-00040 Ack Letter", "date": "2014-02-25T11:04:44.136", "source": "Department of Homeland Security, Under Secretary Office of Intelligenc", "description": "", "access": "public", "doc_id": "1023500-2014-hqap-00040-ack-letter", "pages": 1}], "id": 65230, "foia": 9325, "from_who": "Lasko, Linda", "to_who": "Jason Smathers", "priv_from_who": "", "priv_to_who": "", "date": "2014-02-25T11:04:44", "response": true, "full_html": false, "communication": "Mr. Smathers,\r\n\r\nAttached, please find an acknowledgment of your appeal of the requester fee category determination related to DHS FOIA 14-OIA-0048.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nU.S. Department of Homeland Security\r\n\r\n202-343-1743 (Main FOIA Number)\r\n202-343-4011 (Fax)\r\n\r\nVisit our FOIA website\r\n\r\n\r\nThis communication, along with any attachments, is covered by federal and state law governing electronic communications and may contain confidential and legally privileged information.

I have also attached the final\r\nreport from our latest Program Compliance Review conducted by the Defense\r\nLogistics Agency.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reference to the Defense Logistics list; the Unit Cost is the Department\r\nof Defense (DoD) acquisition cost.  All equipment is provided to state and\r\nlocal agencies at no cost to the receiving agency.  The receiving agencies\r\ndo pay for shipping or they can pick the item up at the base (e.g. Ft.\r\nCarson).  The receiving agency also pays all costs related to bringing the\r\nequipment to usable condition.  For the most part, this is used equipment\r\nand may need some work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all equipment acquired through the program is on this list.  Items with\r\na DEMIL code of A or Q6 fall off the property books after 1 year. These are\r\nitems that are commercially available, such as boots, tools, gloves, etc.\r\n This isn't the flashy stuff, but these items have provided a great benefit\r\nto participating agencies through the years.   Agencies are free to dispose\r\nof DEMIL A  items after one year.  All other items remain on the property\r\nbook as controlled property and must be either returned to the DoD,\r\ntransferred to another agency or disposed of with permission and guidance\r\nfrom the DoD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote that the descriptions provided are military descriptions.  For\r\nexample, grenade launchers are not used by law enforcement agencies to\r\nlaunch grenades.

These programs often permit LEAs to request equipment outside of a local government\u2019s standard budget process and without civilian (non-police) government approval. Local elected officials are frequently not involved in the decision-making, and the general public is similarly unaware of what their LEAs possess.\"\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of promoting public accountability regarding the equipment that law enforcement agencies have received via the 1033 program, I once again respectfully ask that you release an unredacted spreadsheet of such equipment transfers.
